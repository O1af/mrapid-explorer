The US Clean Act defines 6 criteria pollutants and 189 different hazardous air pollutants. The main types of air pollutants are listed below:</p><h3>Criteria Pollutants</h3><ul><li>Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</li><li>Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)</li><li>Lead (Pb)</li><li>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</li><li>Carbon monoxide (CO)</li><li>Particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>)</li></ul><h3>Toxic Pollutants (or hazardous air pollutants)</h3><ul><li><b>Local</b> - Benzene, hydrogen sulfide, diesel exhaust</li><li><b>Regional</b> - Mercury, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)</li><li><b>Global</b> - Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li></ul><h3>Greenhouse gases (toxic if short-lived)</h3><ul><li><b>Long-Lived</b> - Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide, halocarbons (N2O, F11, F12, etc)</li><li><b>Medium-Lived</b> - Methane (CH4)</li><li><b>Short-Lived</b> - Carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane VOC (NMVOCs)</li></ul><h2 id="faq_health">Health Effects</h2><p>Health effects for the six criteria pollutants (ozone, lead, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide) are shown in the table, based on US EPA\u2019s Integrated Science Assessments.</p><p><span style="background-color:yellow">[PUT TABLE HERE SOMEWHERE]</span></p><p>(Table from: https://caphedetroit.sph.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Resource-Manual-3.0-Air-Quality-Health-Environmental-Justice-Website-Version-10-4-16.pdf)</p><ul><li>Thousands of epidemiological and toxicological studies have investigated the link between exposure to air pollutant and health effects.</li><li>These studies also form the basis of air quality standards. </li><li>Air pollution is one of the top environmental factors affecting health. </li><li>Globally, about 7 million people die each year from exposure to both outdoor and indoor air pollutants, mostly from cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5).</li></ul><h3>Who is most affected?</h3><p><span style="background-color:yellow">[PUT IMAGES HERE SOMEWHERE]</span></p><p>Detroit is an ideal setting for this research:</p><ul><li>Heavy burden: 7.3% of deaths attributed to criteria pollutants and air toxics</li><li>Environmental health is a concern for residents</li><li>Minority populations: 85% Black and 7% Latino</li><li>Low SES: 39% live below the poverty line</li></ul><p>Health disparities are an issue:</p><ul><li>Asthma hospitalizations 3x higher than Michigan as a whole</li><li>Asthma deaths 2x higher than Michigan as a whole</li><li>Emission control options are limited; other strategies could be implemented in Detroit</li></ul><h2 id="faq_source">Emission Sources</h2><p>Air pollution has many sources. Some sources are obvious \u2013 like coal-fired boilers, municipal waste incinerators, automobiles, trucks, and buses. Others are not so obvious \u2013 like gasoline stations; dry cleaners; outboard boating equipment; lawn, garden, farm, and construction equipment engines; certain paints, coatings, and varnishes; and various household products. </p><p>Emission sources depend on the pollutant, but they are typically classified into the following type:</p><ul><li>Point sources \u2013 typically with smoke stacks \u2013 power plants, boilers, incinerators</li><li>On-road mobile sources \u2013 cars, trucks, buses</li><li>Off-road mobile sources \u2013 trains, ships, construction equipment</li><li>Area sources \u2013 construction sites, bulk storage areas, building boilers/furnaces</li><li>Event sources \u2013 wildland fires, structure fires, explosions</li><li>Regional sources \u2013 from distant sources, called background</li><li>Secondary sources \u2013 produced from atmospheric chemistry</li></ul><h2 id="faq_breathe">What you breathe - Concentrations and AQI</h2><h3>Concentration</h3><p>In air, pollutants are measured as a concentration:</p><ul><li>For particulate matter (such as PM2.5) concentrations are measured as micrograms per cubic meter or \u03BCg/m<super>3</super></li><li>For gases (such as SO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations can be measured as micrograms per cubic meter or part per million (ppm) or part per billion (ppb)</li></ul><p>This differs from emission rates, which are expressed as tons per year (t/yr) or grams per second (g/s)</p><h3>Air Quality Index (AQI)</h3><p>To account for the different concentration scales, concentrations can be expressed using the Air Quality Index or AQI</p><ul><li>AQI = 100 corresponds to short-term air quality standard, e.g., 35 \u03BCg/m<super>3</super> for PM<sub>2.5</sub> or 70 ppb for O<sub>3</sub></li><li>Must use appropriate averaging time</li><li>EPA typically considers only two pollutants (O<sub>3</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and takes the maximum</li></ul><h2 id="faq_naaqs">Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)</h2><p>The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) apply to the six criteria pollutants.
