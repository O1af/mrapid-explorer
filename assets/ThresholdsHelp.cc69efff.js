<p>The thresholds overlay allows you to see the proportion of measurement values that exceed a given threshold over a given period of time. For example one can chose to overlay the threshold of PM2.5 measurements that exceeded 5 \xB5g/m\xB3 during the past 90 days. The resulting color scale show the percentage of measurements (0-100%) that exceeded 5 \xB5g/m\xB3, with the lightest color being zero or a low number of measurements to the darksest being all or nearly all measurements.</p>
