            <h1>Who we Are</h1>
            <p>
                <b>C</b>ommunity <b>A</b>ction to <b>P</b>romote <b>H</b>ealthy <b>E</b>nvironments (<b>CAPHE</b>) 
                is a partnership among community based organizations, community residents, health service providers 
                and public health researchers.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to develop and implement components of a scientifically-based, community-led public 
                health action plan to reduce air pollution and associated adverse health effects in Detroit and 
                surrounding communities. CAPHE uses a community-based participatory research approach in which 
                partners are involved in all phases of the work. This includes defining the research problem, 
                designing and implementing the study, interpreting and distributing the results, deciding how 
                results will be applied, and applying the results to create a public health action plan to improve 
                health in Detroit. CAPHE has received funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health 
                Sciences and the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation.

            <h2>Current Partnerships</h2>
            <p>
                CAPHE builds on 20 years of community-academic research partnerships. At our inception, we drew on 
                the work of three long-standing partnerships, each of which included community-based organizations, 
                health practice and academic partners: Community Action Against Asthma, the Detroit Community-Academic 
                Urban Research Center and the Healthy Environments Partnership.  Over the years, we have built on and 
                extended our membership, now encompassing representatives from community based organizations, including 
                Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation, Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice, Southwest 
                Detroit Community Benefits Coalition, and Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision; governmental 
                institutions, including the Detroit Health Department and Michigan Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy; 
                community leaders at large; academic institutions, including the University of Michigan’s School of 
                Public Health, Michigan Medicine, and Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, University 
                of Michigan-Dearborn, and Wayne State University. Representatives from each of these organizations 
                comprise the CAPHE Steering Committee, with responsibility for overseeing CAPHE’s day-to-day work, 
                including conducting the basic research underlying the public health action plan, working 
                collaboratively with others to develop the public health action plan, and working to implement 
                prioritized components of the public health action plan.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Structure</h2>
            <p>
                CAPHE’s structure is designed to promote collaboration and shared decision making at all levels of the 
                CAPHE project, and to assure that Detroit residents and leadership have a significant voice in 
                identifying and creating solutions to promote clean air for Detroit’s residents.
